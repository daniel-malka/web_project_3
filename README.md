Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes (responsive site).

1. I spent a lot of time tring to make the site responsive, i felt that im working too hard, the site is responsive for all sizes. wondering if its a demand (for real world workes).

2. would appreciate comments that will help me work more efficiently.

3. had a bit difficulty makeing buttons clickable for the links (no its just text).
4. photos were shrinked using tinyPNG web app.
