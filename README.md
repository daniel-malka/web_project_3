Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes (responsive site).

1. I spent a lot of time tring to make the site responsive, i felt that im working too hard, the site is responsive for all sizes. wondering if its a demand (for real world workes).

2. would appreciate comments that will help me work more efficiently.

3. had a bit difficulty makeing buttons clickable for the links (no its just text).
4. photos were shrinked using tinyPNG web app.

Incorrect distance between cities and about on 768 viewport
the distance between them is equal to the distance on 1280px on my figmafile...
maybe you meant 320px which got fixed
