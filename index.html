                College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the
                south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be

                would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above
                sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the
                bulk of Burundi's exports. The city itself is a mix of
